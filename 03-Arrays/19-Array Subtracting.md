## One-Liner Summary
Digit-by-digit subtraction of two number arrays using borrow, similar to manual arithmetic.

## Pattern
Digit simulation, elementary math, carry/borrow propagation.

## Key Trick
Process from right to left and propagate borrow just like hand subtraction.

## Mistake / Insight
Mistake: Subtracting from left to right breaks place value logic.  
Insight: Borrow must flow from less significant digit to more significant digit.
