PHASE 1 — ARRAY REVISION PLAN (Follow This Before Asking for Test)

You should prepare arrays in 2–3 hours total.
Here’s your exact plan.

✅ 1. Concepts to Revise
✔ Basic array operations:

Traversal

Updating elements

Finding min/max

Searching

✔ Important array patterns:

Prefix sums

Two pointers

Sliding window (basic intro)

Hashing connection

Subarray vs subsequence

Distinguish between:

subarray = contiguous

subsequence = non-contiguous

✔ Sorting understanding:

When sorting helps

When sorting breaks logic (subarrays questions)

✔ Avoiding common errors:

Off-by-one

Index out of bounds

Integer overflow (sum)

Resetting variables correctly

✅ 2. Problems You MUST Solve Before Test

These problems cover easy → medium patterns every interview expects.

⭐ Beginner Level

Find max & min

Reverse an array

Check if array is sorted

Rotate array by k (brute + optimal)

⭐ Intermediate Level

Kadane’s Algorithm — Maximum Subarray Sum

Two Sum (2-pointer + hashing)

Move Zeroes

Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag algorithm)

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

⭐ Important Subarray Patterns

Longest subarray sum = K (if you know prefix-hashing)

Subarray with given sum (positive numbers → sliding window)

Count number of subarrays (prefix sum logic)

⭐ Two Pointer Patterns

Pair with given difference

Pair with given sum (sorted array)

⭐ Bonus (Optional but Good):

Trapping Rainwater

Container With Most Water

These 16 problems give you complete array mastery.

✅ 3. How to Prepare
✔ Step 1: Revise all concepts above (20–30 mins)
✔ Step 2: Solve at least 7–10 problems from the list.
✔ Step 3: Make notes
✔ Step 4: When you feel ready → Say:
Test me on Arrays
