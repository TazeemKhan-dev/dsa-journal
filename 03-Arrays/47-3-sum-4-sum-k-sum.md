## One-Liner Summary
Find all unique k-sized combinations whose sum equals a target using sorting and recursive reduction to 2-Sum.

## Pattern
K-Sum reduction, two pointers, recursion.

## Key Trick
Reduce K-Sum to (K−1)-Sum until reaching 2-Sum solved by two pointers on sorted array.

## Mistake / Insight
Always skip duplicates at every level; otherwise identical combinations appear.
