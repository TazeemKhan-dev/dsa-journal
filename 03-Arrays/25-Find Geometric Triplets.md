## One-Liner Summary
Find all triplets (a, b, c) such that they form a geometric progression using the identity b² = a × c.

## Pattern
Two Pointers | Algebraic Invariant

## Key Trick
Replace ratio checking with multiplication: b*b = a*c to avoid floating point operations.

## Mistake / Insight
Mistake: Using division or floating point ratios.
Insight: Squared middle term equals product of extremes in a GP.
