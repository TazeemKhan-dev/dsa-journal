DSA Notes Navigator is a production-grade learning system I built for long-term Data Structures & Algorithms revision, focused on structured navigation, active recall, and keyboard-first workflows rather than competitive coding or passive reading. It includes a GitHub-style explorer for my personally authored DSA notes, a flashcard-based Revision Mode, split-view comparison of approaches, and a sketch layer for dry runs. All markdown is fetched securely through a backend-controlled GitHub API with quota enforcement, reflecting real-world system design principles such as predictable UX, backend authority, and long-term maintainability. The source repository is private and can be shared on request.
