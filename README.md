# 🧠 DSA Journal

A clean, structured, and pattern-focused journal documenting everything I learn while solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems.  
This journal is optimized for **placements**, **interviews**, and **long-term retention**, not just problem-solving.

It follows a simple rule:

> ❝ Don’t memorize solutions — master patterns. ❞

## 🌟 Why This Journal Exists

Most students solve hundreds of problems and forget everything after a few weeks.  
This journal fixes that by forcing me to write only the **core insights**, not long notes.

Each entry takes **20–30 seconds** and includes:

- **Pattern**  
- **Key Trick**  
- **Mistake**  
- **How to identify similar problems**

These four points are enough to build:
- strong intuition  
- long-term memory  
- pattern recognition  
- interview-level problem-solving ability
