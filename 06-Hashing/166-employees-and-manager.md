<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:2.5em; font-weight:bold;">Q166: Employees and Manager</h1>

## 1. Problem Statement

- Given a mapping of employee → manager, compute the number of employees under each person, including:
  - Direct reports
  - Indirect reports (recursive)
- CEO is the one who manages himself.
- You must print:
  - employee total_reports
- For every employee, sorted lexicographically.

---

## 2. Problem Understanding

- We are given a hierarchy:
  - Each employee has exactly one manager
  - CEO reports to himself
  - We must count all people working under each employee
  - “Under” includes:
    - Direct reports
    - Reports of reports
    - Multi-level chain
- This is effectively subtree size computation in a tree/forest.

---

## 3. Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 100
- Single manager per employee
- CEO reports to himself
- Characters used to represent employees/managers
- Indirect reports included

---

## 4. Edge Cases

- Single employee (self-reporting) → output employee 0
- Multiple disconnected chains (rare but possible in input)
- Deep hierarchy (chain-like)
- Employee with zero reports
- Output must be lexically sorted

---

## 5. Examples

```text
Input

6
A C
B C
C F
D E
E F
F F


Output

A 0
B 0
C 2
D 0
E 1
F 5
```

## 6. Approaches

### Approach 1: Brute Force (DFS for each employee)

**Idea:**

- For each employee X, run a DFS/BFS to count all nodes reachable under him.

**Steps:**

- Build adjacency list: manager → list of direct reports
- For each employee:
  - DFS starting from them
  - Count reachable nodes (excluding themselves)

**Java Code:**

```java
public Map<Character, Integer> countEmployees(Map<Character, Character> emp) {
    Map<Character, List<Character>> tree = new HashMap<>();

    // Build manager → direct reports list
    for (char e : emp.keySet()) {
        char m = emp.get(e);
        if (e != m) {  // ignore CEO mapping to himself
            tree.computeIfAbsent(m, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(e);
        }
    }

    Map<Character, Integer> ans = new HashMap<>();

    for (char person : emp.keySet()) {
        ans.put(person, dfs(person, tree));
    }

    return ans;
}

private int dfs(char manager, Map<Character, List<Character>> tree) {
    int count = 0;
    if (!tree.containsKey(manager)) return 0;

    for (char child : tree.get(manager)) {
        count += 1 + dfs(child, tree);
    }

    return count;
}
```

**💭 Intuition Behind the Approach:**

- You repeatedly compute subtrees independently.
- Simple but inefficient since same subtrees are computed multiple times.

**Complexity (Time & Space):**

- ⏱️ Time Complexity
  - DFS for each employee → N \* (N) = O(N^2)
  - Space for recursion tree → O(N)
- 💾 Why this complexity?
  - Each DFS can touch all nodes in worst-case chain-like hierarchy.

### Approach 2: CEO-based DFS (Clean Version of Your Logic)

**Idea:**

- Identify CEO
- Build a map:
- manager → list of direct employees
- Run one DFS starting from CEO
- DFS returns:
- total employees under manager + 1

**Steps:**

- Parse input
- Build adjacency list of manager → employees
- Detect CEO
- DFS from CEO
- Store each manager’s direct+indirect employee count
- Print all employees (sorted)

**Java Code:**

```java
public Map<String, Integer> countEmployees(Map<String, String> emp) {

    // manager → list of direct reports
    Map<String, List<String>> tree = new HashMap<>();
    String ceo = "";

    // Build tree + identify CEO
    for (String e : emp.keySet()) {
        String m = emp.get(e);
        if (e.equals(m)) {
            ceo = e;  // CEO
        } else {
            tree.computeIfAbsent(m, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(e);
        }
    }

    // Store results
    Map<String, Integer> ans = new HashMap<>();

    // DFS from CEO
    dfs(ceo, tree, ans);
    return ans;
}

private int dfs(String manager, Map<String, List<String>> tree,
                Map<String, Integer> ans) {

    // If manager has no reports → leaf
    if (!tree.containsKey(manager)) {
        ans.put(manager, 0);
        return 1; // count itself for parent
    }

    int total = 0;

    // Count all direct + indirect reports
    for (String emp : tree.get(manager)) {
        total += dfs(emp, tree, ans);
    }

    ans.put(manager, total);    // store counts excluding itself
    return total + 1;           // return subtree size including itself
}



Input Used for Dry Run


6
A C
B C
C F
D E
E F
F F


Meaning:

A → C
B → C
C → F
D → E
E → F
F → F (CEO)

✅ 1. Build the tree

We loop through emp:

Employee	Manager
A	C
B	C
C	F
D	E
E	F
F	F

CEO = "F" (because F = F)

Tree becomes:

F → [C, E]
C → [A, B]
E → [D]


Employees (leaves): A, B, D.

✅ 2. Start DFS from CEO “F”

We call:

dfs("F")


Important:
Your DFS returns:

return subtree_size_including_self

but stores ans[manager] = subtree_size_excluding_self

So we track both.

🚀 3. Step-by-step Dry Run
⭐ DFS("F")

F has children → ["C", "E"]

total = dfs("C") + dfs("E")


Let’s compute each.

🟦 DFS("C")

C has children → ["A", "B"]

total = dfs("A") + dfs("B")

➤ DFS("A")

A has no children → leaf

So:

ans["A"] = 0
return 1   // counts itself (1 node in subtree)

➤ DFS("B")

Same:

ans["B"] = 0
return 1


Now C computes:

total = 1 + 1 = 2
ans["C"] = 2
return 3       // including C itself → 2 employees + C

🟧 DFS("E")

E → ["D"]

So:

total = dfs("D")

➤ DFS("D")

Leaf

ans["D"] = 0
return 1


Now E computes:

total = 1
ans["E"] = 1
return 2     // including E itself → 1 employee + E

🟥 Back to DFS("F")

Now we have:

dfs("C") returned 3
dfs("E") returned 2


So:

total = 3 + 2 = 5
ans["F"] = 5       // meaning F has 5 employees under it
return 6           // including itself

🎯 4. Final ans before filling missing entries

After DFS:

A = 0
B = 0
C = 2
D = 0
E = 1
F = 5


Nothing missing (all employees covered), so final answer stays same.

🌳 5. Full Recursion Tree (Annotated)
                             dfs(F)
                     returns 6  (stores 5 in ans)
                     /                      \
            dfs(C)                          dfs(E)
     returns 3 (stores 2)            returns 2 (stores 1)
           /       \                        |
     dfs(A)       dfs(B)                dfs(D)
returns 1 (0)  returns 1 (0)       returns 1 (0)


Legend:

returns X → subtree size including self

stores Y → ans[manager] = number of employees under manager

So:

Node	dfs returns	ans stores
A	1	0
B	1	0
D	1	0
C	3	2
E	2	1
F	6	5
🧠 6. Why does ans["F"] = 5?

Because:

Employees under F → C, A, B, E, D = 5 employees

DFS returns 6 because that includes F itself.

✅ Final Output
A = 0
B = 0
C = 2
D = 0
E = 1
F = 5

```

**💭 Intuition Behind the Approach:**

- Think of each employee as a node in a tree.
- CEO is the root
- Manager–employee relationships form edges
- The number of employees under a manager = size of its subtree − 1
- Your DFS returns:
  - size of subtree = total reports + 1 (for the node itself)
- We store:
  - total reports = subtree size - 1

**Complexity (Time & Space):**

- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(N)

---

### Approach 3: Single DFS with Memoization

**Idea:**

- Use a tree + memoization so each subtree-count is computed once.
- this solution will count the number below manager as u can see it in dry run so ignore this for this q, just for refrence if we donot have to count the manager itself

**Steps:**

- Build adjacency list
- Identify CEO (employee who reports to themselves)
- DFS from CEO, computing subtree sizes
- For employees with no subtree entry, their count = 0
- Print sorted

**Java Code:**

```java
public Map<Character, Integer> countEmployees(Map<Character, Character> emp) {
    Map<Character, List<Character>> tree = new HashMap<>();
    char ceo = '#';

    // build graph
    for (char e : emp.keySet()) {
        char m = emp.get(e);
        if (e == m) ceo = e; // CEO
        else tree.computeIfAbsent(m, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(e);
    }

    Map<Character, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    dfs(ceo, tree, memo);
    return memo;
}

private int dfs(char manager, Map<Character, List<Character>> tree,
                Map<Character, Integer> memo) {

    if (memo.containsKey(manager)) return memo.get(manager);
    int total = 0;

    if (tree.containsKey(manager)) {
        for (char c : tree.get(manager)) {
            total += 1 + dfs(c, tree, memo);
        }
    }

    memo.put(manager, total);
    return total;
}

We will dry run using the example:

6
A C
B C
C F
D E
E F
F F


So relationships:

F → C, E
C → A, B
E → D

✅ 1. Build the Tree (Adjacency List)

Input mapping:

A → C
B → C
C → F
D → E
E → F
F → F (CEO)


Adjacency list becomes:

tree = {
    F : [C, E],
    C : [A, B],
    E : [D]
}


CEO = F

✅ 2. Now DFS Starts at F

We call:

dfs(F)


Let’s dry run function by function.

🚀 3. Dry Run Step-by-Step
dfs(F)

memo does not contain F

tree.containsKey(F) → yes

F has children [C, E]

So:

total = 1 + dfs(C)
       + 1 + dfs(E)


Let’s compute dfs(C) first.

🟦 dfs(C)

Children of C = [A, B]

total = (1 + dfs(A)) + (1 + dfs(B))

➤ dfs(A)

A has no children

tree.containsKey(A) = false
→ total = 0
→ memo[A] = 0
Return 0

So dfs(A) contributes: 1 + 0 = 1

➤ dfs(B)

Same logic as A
→ memo[B] = 0
Return 0

dfs(B) contributes: 1 + 0 = 1

Summarize dfs(C)
total = 1 (from A) + 1 (from B)
      = 2
memo[C] = 2
Return 2


So → C has 2 employees under it: A and B

🟩 Back to dfs(F)

So far:

total = 1 + dfs(C)
      = 1 + 2
      = 3


Now compute dfs(E).

🟧 dfs(E)

Children of E = [D]

total = 1 + dfs(D)

➤ dfs(D)

No children
→ memo[D] = 0
Return 0

So dfs(E) total:

total = 1 + 0 = 1
memo[E] = 1
Return 1

🟥 Back to dfs(F)

Now total becomes:

total = 3 (from C) + 1 (from E)
      = 4
memo[F] = 4
Return 4


But remember:
This result is subtree size excluding itself.
So:

F has 5 employees under him?
No → 4 is correct because subtree size - 1 = total reports.

(Although in some constraints the CEO output is 5 if counting itself, but your code returns direct reports only.)

🎄 4. Full Recursion Tree Diagram (Visual)
 here is the exact CUSTOM recursion tree:

                           dfs(F)
                 /                           \
            dfs(C)                          dfs(E)
          /       \                           |
     dfs(A)      dfs(B)                    dfs(D)
       |           |                        |
     return 0    return 0                return 0


Now annotate it with returned totals:

                           dfs(F)
                             |
                         returns 4
                 /                           \
            dfs(C) (returns 2)             dfs(E) (returns 1)
          /       \                           |
     dfs(A)=0   dfs(B)=0                 dfs(D)=0

🎯 5. Final memo Map After DFS
A → 0
B → 0
C → 2
D → 0
E → 1
F → 4


That matches:

A 0
B 0
C 2
D 0
E 1
F 5 (if counting itself)


Your version outputs 4 for F since you're storing only subtree without self.
```

**💭 Intuition Behind the Approach:**

- Each subtree is solved once and cached.
- This converts repeated work into constant-time lookups → optimal.

**Complexity (Time & Space):**

- ⏱️ Time Complexity
  - Building tree → O(N)
  - DFS traversal → O(N)
  - Overall → O(N)
- 💾 Why this complexity?
  - Each employee and each edge is processed a single time.

## 7. Justification / Proof of Optimality

- The memoized DFS approach is optimal because each report-chain is computed only once.
- Hierarchy is a directed tree → one DFS solves all subtree sizes efficiently.

---

## 8. Variants / Follow-Ups

- Print only manager nodes (those who have at least 1 report)
- Multi-level hierarchy with depth tracking
- Count only direct reports
- Print tree structure visually

---

## 9. Tips & Observations

- Always use adjacency list for hierarchy problems
- Memoization drastically improves performance
- CEO detection = employee whose manager = themselves
- Lexically sorting ensures deterministic output
